# 2048

## How to play

On the [Releases](https://github.com/EnzoGabriel29/two-oh-four-eight/releases)
tab, check for the latest version and download the
file named `2048.jar` corresponding to this version.

Change your directory to the directory where the file
was downloaded and run the following command to make the file executable:

    chmod +x 2048.jar

Now, just run it by typing

    ./2048.jar

The game window should appear. You can play by using the arrow keys.
The [same rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)#Gameplay) still apply.
